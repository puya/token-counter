Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. These challenges often overlap, and recent advancements have been driven by deep learning, a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks).

Tokenization is a fundamental step in modern NLP. It is the process of breaking down a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, characters, or subwords. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" might be tokenized into the following list of words: ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"].

Different tokenization strategies exist, and the choice of tokenizer can significantly impact the performance of an NLP model. The `tiktoken` library, used in this tool, is a fast and efficient tokenizer developed by OpenAI for use with their large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4. It uses a byte pair encoding (BPE) algorithm to create a vocabulary of tokens from a large corpus of text. This allows it to handle a wide range of text and produce a compact representation of the input.

This concludes the test article. We expect the token count to be a few hundred tokens, providing a good example for our CLI tool.
